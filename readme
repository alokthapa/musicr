Musicr

A non-working multi-track recorder for android.

What can it do?

Currently, it can create a new project and record different tracks which can be mixed down to one track. You can also record a track while playing another.

Why is it opensource?

Because I'm using a lot of code that I know is GPL and some stuff that didn't come with any license.

What has it been tested on?

It has been tested on my Moto Cliq leaked 2.1. I don't know if it works on any other!
